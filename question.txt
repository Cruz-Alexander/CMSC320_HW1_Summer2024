I am looking forward to enrolling in CMSC320 because it provides an introduction, to the data science process, which's crucial for turning messy unorganized data into useful insights. This course covers topics like analysis, data mining, machine learning algorithms and visualizing information. Moreover understanding how to manage large scale data and utilize cloud computing will give me the tools I need to handle and analyze data, which is increasingly vital in todays data focused environment. By taking CMSC320 my goal is to establish a foundation, in data science that will improve my ability to draw conclusions from data and apply these skills in practical situations.
